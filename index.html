        <p>About Me</p>

        <p>I'm a dedicated Computer Science student at the University of Houston, currently working towards my 
        Bachelor's degree. With a passion for technology and problem-solving, I've immersed myself in learning the 
        core principles of software development, algorithms, and data structures. My academic journey has equipped me 
        with a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, and I'm particularly interested 
        in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and web development.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout my studies, I've engaged in various projects that challenge me to think critically and apply my 
        skills in real-world scenarios. Whether it's building web applications, developing algorithms, or exploring 
        new tech trends, I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>As I near graduation, I'm eager to transition from academia to the tech industry, where I can contribute my 
        skills, creativity, and enthusiasm to meaningful projects. I'm excited about the future and the potential to 
        make a positive impact in the world through technology.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest in tech, participating in hackathons, or 
        collaborating with peers on innovative projects. I'm always open to new challenges and look forward to 
        connecting with like-minded individuals and professionals in the tech community.</p>
