        <p>About Me</p>

        <p>I'm a dedicated Computer Science student at the University of Houston, currently working towards my 
        Bachelor's degree. With a passion for technology and problem-solving, I've immersed myself in learning the 
        core principles of software development, algorithms, and data structures. My academic journey has equipped me 
        with a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, and I'm particularly interested 
        in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and web development.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout my studies, I've engaged in various projects that challenge me to think critically and apply my 
        skills in real-world scenarios. Whether it's building web applications, developing algorithms, or exploring 
        new tech trends, I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>As I near graduation, I'm eager to transition from academia to the tech industry, where I can contribute my 
        skills, creativity, and enthusiasm to meaningful projects. I'm excited about the future and the potential to 
        make a positive impact in the world through technology.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest in tech, participating in hackathons, or 
        collaborating with peers on innovative projects. I'm always open to new challenges and look forward to 
        connecting with like-minded individuals and professionals in the tech community.</p>

            <p>At Reaching Audiences Worldwide, I developed and maintained web applications using HTML, CSS, and 
            JavaScript. My role focused heavily on User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design, ensuring 
            that the user interfaces I implemented were both functional and visually appealing. I managed databases 
            and optimized queries using Azure SQL, and I leveraged Microsoft Azure for cloud-based development and 
            deployment. Collaboration with cross-functional teams was key to ensuring seamless integration and 
            functionality of our web applications. I was involved in the full web development cycle, from initial 
            concept to final deployment.</p>

            peak and non-peak seasons. My responsibilities include picking, loading, receiving, replenishing, and 
            shipping products to meet company production and service standards. I operate complex robot machinery, 
            which has resulted in an 80% increase in throughput. Additionally, I perform the duties of a Process 
            Assistant (PA) when requested, such as supervising the warehouse shipping dock and overseeing associates. 
            I efficiently use Microsoft Suite Applications, Supply Side Platform, and Slack to coordinate dock doors
